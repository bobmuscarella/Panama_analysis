## **Muscarella and Uriarte (in press) Do community-weighted mean trait values reflect optimal strategies?**

Description: An Rdata object containing a list with four elements.

`$site_data`: data.frame of mean annual precipitation (ppt) and community-weighted mean trait values for each of the 12 study sites.  CWM values are given for wood density ('wd'), leaf mass per area ('lma'), and maximum height ('hmax').

`$ppt_at_RORmax`: vector holding the values of mean annual precipitation in grid cells where each species was predicted to have its highest relative occurrence rate (from ENMs).

`$species_data`: data.frame with relative occurrence rate ('ror'), deltaCWM ('deltacwm'), and basal area ('ba') for each species ('species') in each plot ('site') and for each trait ('trait').

`$species_names`: data.frame holding the taxonomic information ('order','family','genus','species','code','binom') for study species.  The 'code' column corresponds to entries in the other data objects.
